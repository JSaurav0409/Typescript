# TypeScript – Learning From Scratch 🚀

This repository documents my **journey of learning TypeScript from the ground up**.  
It includes structured notes, hands-on practice, and small projects aimed at building a **strong TypeScript foundation** for real-world frontend and backend development.

- Move from **JavaScript → TypeScript** with clarity
